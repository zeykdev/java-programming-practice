#1. Print the Slash
DIAGONAL LINES?!?! Cody can’t print diagonal lines (the slash \ character) normally because it is a special character. 
Unless there is a way for us to bypass this limitation. Hmmmm… Try to print a slash and see.

Sample Output:
\



#2. Special Cody
That age problem was a close one, huh? But it seems that wasn’t enough to convince the kids that Cody IS NOT a robot, 
after all, Cody’s face is literally a computer monitor so who could blame them? Now, the kids are testing Cody by having
him print special characters like " and \. They assumed that Cody wouldn’t be able to print these special characters if he 
functioned under a computer program but lucky for us, The Programmer anticipated something like this, remember? To teach these 
kids a lesson, have Cody print Look! I can print "special" 'characters' like \. to clear all suspicions of him being a robot.

Sample Output:
Look! I can print "special" 'characters' like \.



#3. The Word of the Day
This month is English month so everyday in class, a student must present his/her 'word of the day' and explain what it is. Today 
is Cody's turn, he decides to present the word 'apostrophe' and show them how it looks. Write a program that prints an apostrophe(') 
for the class.

Sample Output:

'
